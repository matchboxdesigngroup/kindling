* Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
* There should be an entry for every single version.
* The same types of changes should be grouped.
* Versions and sections should be linkable.
* The latest version comes first.
* The release date of each version is displayed.
* The release versions should follow Semantic Versioning. (https://semver.org/)

== Changelog ==

== The following entries serve as basic guidelines and can be removed in the future after a few version releases. ==
